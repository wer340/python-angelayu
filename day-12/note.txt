this concept of global and local scope doesn't just apply to variables as i alluded to before it 
also applies to function and basically anything else you name this is a ✅consept called the namespace 

anything that you give a name to has a namespace and that namespace is valid in certain scope

✅whenever you give name to anything  a function or a varible you have to be aware of where you cereated it
