python dictionary and nesting
line of program instructions for the computer and dictionarues are realy useful
allow  group together  tag realated a piece ofinformation

✅table
dictonary  has two part   ✔ key ✔value
{key:value}  > dic={"bug" : "an error in a program ..","function":"A piece of code taht you can "}  ▶dic["bug"]="an error in a program .."
❌key spell more time  wrong by devloper  ker error   ❌bog >bug✅

second error   key whithout "" quote   dic={bug : "an error in a program ..",function:"A piece of code taht you can "} ❌❌

nice to do
{  next line first key   and in a first of new line another key 

✔✅adding new item to dictionary
dic["loop"]="The action of doing something over ..."
✅create emty dictinary 
empty_dic={} if a dictonary this value  clear all data 

loop in dictionary

for thing in dic::
	print(thing) # output key
