list comprehension thing   that  not have been seen other language
less  write code â˜•
numbers=[num*2 for num in range(1,6)]

conditional list comprehension
new_list=[new_item for name in names if test]
so the test in this case is we are checking to see if the test[length of the name is now greater than five]
and if this name that we are currently looping through passes this test then we get to specify what the new item should be
