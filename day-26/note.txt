list comprehension thing   that  not have been seen other language
less  write code ☕
numbers=[num*2 for num in range(1,6)]

conditional list comprehension
new_list=[new_item for name in names if test]
so the test in this case is we are checking to see if the test[length of the name is now greater than five]
and if this name that we are currently looping through passes this test then we get to specify what the new item should be

comprehension dictionary
https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_dictionary_items.asp
The items() method returns a view object. The view object contains the key-value pairs of the dictionary, as tuples in a list.
The view object will reflect any changes done to the dictionary, see example below.
#notice convert tuple type so dict also convert to tuple
dict_best_students={student:score for (student,score) in dict_students.items() if score>70   }
#loop dictionary ☕   ▶for (key,value) in dict.items():
pandas allow  loop through row of aa data frame  wit   iterrows()
