greet() function
 
def my_function(something):  input  
but notice how its expecting some sort of input inside the parentheses  tells me that it wants to receive a name 

   âœ…in programming  âœ…something(parameter[name of data])=123(argument [piece of data=actual value of data])  
make same indent many line of code â–¶â–¶  ctrl +]

def my_function(something1,something2)    âœ…ðŸŒ¿âœ”positional argument  because when we call the func 
we havent spcified anywhere which particular parameter we want to associate
now this is the default way of calling func becaause on one hand  âœ…âœ…when you are typing out the code 
maany unexpect order happen
you could use soething called keyword argument instead  of just adding argument into the function call like this
def my_function(a=1,b=2,c=3) if change order def my_function(c=3,b=2,a=1)  it still going to abide by this binding
