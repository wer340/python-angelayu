once python open the file it basiclly take up some of resource of your copmuter at some point later on it might adecide to close it
and free up those resources so instad  we are going to tell it to close down  the file manually this line of code
similar consept  alot lots lots of tab in chrome browser 
write()  before open(mode="w")  deafult mode="r"   mode="a" append    \n new line

which represents the c drive so thid entire part
