class inheritance
modify class and give more capability
2--
its process of inheriting behavior and appearance from an existing class is known as class inheritance 
not only can inherit appearance but we can also inherit behavior 
how can define
class Fish(Animal):
def __init__(self):
	super().__init__()
now in order to get fish class to inherit from another class all we have to do add a set of parentheses after the name of the class 
and then in order to get a hold of everthing that an animal has is so its attributes and methods all we have to do is inside the init
add this super().__init__()  and the super refer to the superclass  initial everything that the super class can do in our fish
two part[(Animal),(super().__init__())] allow to inherte all atributes and methods
what it allows us to do is to take an existing aclass that we have created
