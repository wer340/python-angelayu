this concept of global and local scope doesn't just apply to variables as i alluded to before it 
also applies to function and basically anything else you name this is a ✅consept called the namespace 

anything that you give a name to has a namespace and that namespace is valid in certain scope

✅whenever you give name to anything  a function or a varible you have to be aware of where you cereated it

trrible thing  local var  same name with global var

3---
refrence before assignment mean user in scope not define var  and  process on var that not define
avoid modyfing global scope

dont try modify in local scope but you can do instead

4---
global  var    you are never planing on change it ever again like  PI=3.14
turn into uppercase  constatnt var  in order to  never chang
URL=""  PI=3.14
