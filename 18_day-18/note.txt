pencolor((r,g,b)) python tuple   (1,2,3)a data type  it has round brackets around it and then each of the item inside are aeparated by a comma
doesnt it not look a like bit a list [1,2,3]   
my_tuple=(1,2,3)   my_tuple[0]=1
whats diffrence with list ?
a tuple is going to be carved in stone 
âœ…so you cant change the value like you can with list  âœ”ðŸ’Žimmutable
why would you use of tuple  a constant list sort of list 
convert to list   list(my_tuple)
