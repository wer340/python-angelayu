how actually class
2---
you have the class keyword followed by the name of your class and  then a semicolon and then all of the code thats in your class 
will follow this and it will be  
when 
class User:
	pass	
user_1=User()
now we get an error here because theres an indent expected so basically python doesnt like it when you cereate something like a class or 
when you create something like a function and you have a semi colon but you dont have anything inside that functional class 
for example
def function():
	pass
print("hello")

if i just immediately wanted to print hello afterward  i get exactly the same erro ; indent expected its expected this function you have created or this class
you have created to have some sort of content before you go head and do something else so how can we fix this ? well  if we actually realy want to leave this function 
or this class empty âœ” we can use keyword pass and all it does is it just passes it says i dont want to have a go right now just continue to the next line of code 
AND THIS GET RID OF OUR ERROR both in the function as well as  in our class declaration
