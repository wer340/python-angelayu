ahow can read and analize them    
csv  comma seprated value
csv are a very common way of representing  taabula data like spreedsheet
 when open  csv  pretty painful to work with data  whic all string format seprated with commas
take alot of cleaning to actually be able to extract each column
['day,temp,codition\n', 'monday,12,sunny\n']
python lang thats used realy heaavily for adata processing data analysis there s alot of great tools
for working with tabula data
▶import csv ✅ lib 
csv number cant read  int   deafult string   
this issue for  alot row and data  cause so much  faff
pandas   lib ☕ super helpful super powerful data analysis 
install package 
type csv object 
type pandas <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
data structure   2 way     series  and dataFrame
data["temp"]   <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
data frame kind of equivalent of your whole table here 
so every single sheet inside an excel file or inside a google sheet file would be considered a data frame
series is baasicly equivalent to a list it s kind of a single column in your table
