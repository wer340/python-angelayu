# oop `O`bject-`o`riented `p`rogramming
---------------------------------
code complex   try to do manaage  try to do understand   whole of bunch code 
  at some point the logic of our code starts looking very very ✅spaghetti like
`realy hard track` actually whats ging on code 
this style of programming is caalled ✅`procedural programming`  earliest paradigm of programming
fortran cobol

![history](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wer340/python-angelayu/main/day-16/image/aprocedural_programming.png)
---------
increase in the number of relationship  that we need to remember and manage 
start making it look a bit `like` the dating `history of the kardashians`
`paradim oop` come  thats real handy
by splitting up this a `big complex task` into `seprate modules` then we can all work on this acar simultaneously
**massivly optimize  and  make quicker**
plus on top of that aa lot of these ✅modules are `reusable` 
beacuse we have taken out these individual chunks of code and modularized  using **Object-oriented programming**
✔a larger task into that smaller pieces  aand each of those pieces can be worked on by seprate team sepraate people 
and also each of those pieces becom reusable if we need the same functionality
resturant  have many worker  we was understanding is to be big resturant but  have a few worker means mini resturaant

#### how to use oop
the reason why ✅✅`object oriented programming`   is called that is beacuse its `trying to model a real world object`
every module waiter chef ..  two thing   
```python
#has attributes
is_holding_plate=True
#does  method
def takee_order():
  #statement
def take_payment():
  #statement

```
## attributes
![attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wer340/python-angelayu/main/day-16/image/attributes.png)
## methods 
![methods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wer340/python-angelayu/main/day-16/image/methods.png)
--------
its  data attached particular object   object have thing  aand  can do thing  essential  all of data particular module together into object  same thing
✅✅we can generate as many of these as  we want from the same ✔`blueprint`
oop we call this `blueprint` or `this type  a class` we call these individual object that are generated from the blueprint an object
how you use these class blueprint to create an actual  object
## blueprint
![blueprint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wer340/python-angelayu/main/day-16/image/paascalCase.png)
------------
`blueprint` which models a real-life    is known as the class
this `class` that we can `genrate` as many `object` as we want create new object from aa blueprint 
```python
car=CarBlueprint()  #PascalCase   CodeCase 
#which is normally written with the first letter of each word capitalized which is known as ✔pascal case
timmy=Turtle()  
my_screnn=Screen() 
print(timmy)   //expect  adress of loaction
my_screnn.cancheight #object attribute  output value height 
```
✅this is very different from say  if we just printed a string or a number  
from [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) import Turtle ,screen     
this is actually object  printed  [turtle guide](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
