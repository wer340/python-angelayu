oop   big gun 
code complex   try to do manaage  try to do understand   whole of bunch code 
  at some point the logic of our code starts looking very very ✅spaghetti like
realy hard track actually whats ging on code 
this style of programming is caalled ✅procedural programming  earliest paradigm of programming
fortran cobol
increase in the number of relationship  that we need to remember and manage 
start making it look a bit like the dating history of the karashinaans
paradim oop come  thats real handy
by splitting up this abig complex task into seprate modules then we can all work on this acar simultaneously
massivly optimize  and  make quicker
plus on top of taht aa lot of these ✅modules are reusable 
beacuse we have taken out these individual chunks of code and modularized  using object oriented programming
✔a larger task into taht smaller pieces  aand each of those pieces can be worked on by seprate team sepraate people 
and also each of those pieces becom reusable if we need the same functionality
resturant  have many worker  understand  big resturant but  have a few worker means mini resturaant

how to use oop
the reason why ✅✅object oriented programming   is called that is beacuse its trying to model a real world object
every module waiter chef ..  two thing   ✔has{is_holding_plate=True}  ✔does{def takee_order(): def take_payment():}
has  > attributes     does > method
its  data attached particular object   object have thing  aand  can do thing  essential  all of data particular module together into object  same thing
✅✅we can generate as many of these as  we want from the same ✔blueprint
oop we call this blueprint or this type  a class we call these individual object that are gebrated from the blueprint an     object
how you use these class blueprint to create an actual 
3------
blueprint which models a real-life    is known as the class
this class that we can genrate as many object as we want 
create new object from aa blueprint  ✔car=CarBlueprint()   which is normally written with the first letter of each word capitalized which is known as ✔pascal case
✅✅✅this is very different from say  if we just printed a string or a number 
from turtle imort Turtle ,screen      timmy=Turtle()   my_screnn=Screen()   print(timmy)   //expect  adress of loaction
this is actually object  printed
object attribute  my_screnn.cancheight    output value height  screen  
object method		my_screnn.exitonclick()  timmy.shape("turtle")

how to add packages
but a package differs from a module in the sense thaat its actually 
a whole bunch of code that other people have written lots and lots of file all packaged together to achieve some sort of goal or purpose
we waant create a table of pokemon and their type 
https://pypi.org/   ✔python package index
https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/
file▶setting ▶my_work_dir_name▶ python interpreter ▶+ sign  > install anu package
