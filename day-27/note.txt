pre install  tkinter
windows=tkinter.Tk()  not happen❌
it will go straight away to exit code zero and 
the reason for this is because we need a way of keeping the windows on the screen
what tkinter has done here is its gone ahead created athe window  sees that theres no more instructions
and then it basically ended the program now we want instead is to sort of have while loop that basically
just keep on runing so something like a while true and inside this while loop
it holds on to this window and keeps on linsting to see if there anything else that the user is going to
interact with that windows so that it can respond when that hapen 
so this loop in tkinter  all you have to do is get your window to simply ✅call mainloop()

if you have a argument 9 of 10 time a spcefy  ? dont want type argument

unlimited arguments   
i would have to add n1 n2 n3 n4 ,...
but then i would have to add four number every single time so what if i wanted to make this function
more flexible and to allow any number of argument to be used as the input well what i can do is to simply change the code 
to use this ✔asterix[*] and then name of parameter  that name args is by convention 
 unlimted posional argument    each arg collect  and put in ✅tuple type with position 
def add_sum(*args) add_sum(1,6,3,4) args[1]=6 args[3]=4
7--
if we want to define  for args a spicefic keyword 
double astrix   key word args   (**kwargs)  return a  ✅dictionary type
def sum(**kwargs):  sum(num1=12,num2=32)
  for key,value in kwargs

Tk   option implement with **kwargs 
kw["name"]
kw.get("name") >not error   give  none response

pack 
widget next to each other in a vaguely logical format and by deafult pack will always start from the top and then pack every 
other widget just below the previous one   as i mention you can change this by adding a side parameter and you can change it 
the problem with pack is that its actually quite difficult to specify a precise position 
✅✅thats why there not just a single layout manager but there lots of others 
which is called ✔placed  💎place  is all about precise positioning  my_label.place(x=,y=)
