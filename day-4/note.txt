MODULE   this part of code   split for readable code 
module was created that divide the large code to chunk code  and every developer work on a module

same dir  touch my_module.py  then   other py file  import my_module      then uses from var fuunc my_module.py

one of the easiest ways of getting the computer to generate some random number or random sequence is by using something called a seed 
Something truly random to start with then they can extrapolate from that and create random number or random sequence depending on what it is that we need
 The seed() method is used to initialize the random number generator. ✅✅By default the random number generator uses the current system time
If you use the same seed value twice you will get the same random number twice

data structure  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html
python list  that uses many many time in future 
list   fruits=[item1,item2]  data structure    fruits[0] offset  is zero   ▶ fruits=|[item1,item2]  | >>offset    if [-1]  offset start last list
list.append(x) add item
