we know that it was originally created for javaScript but later became almost the standard of transferring data across the 
 internet  and reason for it is realy simple  if you take something like a python dictionary lets say you have a a
wardrobe its kind of like you are going to IKEA you spotted a wardrobe you would like but you dont want to carry this home in its 
entirely it might not even fit in your car well what do you do  well in ikea at least the way they have solved it is they sell
you a flat pack  so all the pieces flat against each other and you go home and you build it yourself 
this is equivalent of a json its very minimalist it doesnt have a lot of spaces alot of indent 
it just has a couple of symbol to denote which are the key 
once you recevie this json then you can reconstitute it back to your original python dictionary
